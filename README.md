# Chrome Extension for Exam Proctoring

This Chrome extension is designed to help prevent cheating during online exams. It activates when a user opens a test page, and requires the user to enter their name, email, and test invitation code. Upon clicking the "Start Test" button, the user's information is sent to the backend server for storage. The extension then performs a camera and audio check, and initiates image proctoring, sending images to the server every three minutes (configurable). All image and user activity data are stored on the backend server.

## Installation

1. Download the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/exam-proctoring/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz).
2. Open the Chrome browser and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to "Developer mode".
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory.
5. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.
